# tools-for-trading

I have worked on tools for technical analysis in trading. Here is my work. You will find python code, to get price history, to find resistances and supports automaticaly, an original average to find the actual tendance... Their is also a Backtest exemple but the code is not perfect. You will have a little bit of work to do your owne backtest.

I have also fonctions for rsi, exponential rsi, bollinger bands, and averages. I will post it soon on my github, but I have to clean theme before.

I work in python with big lists and tables.

I hope my work can help you :)
